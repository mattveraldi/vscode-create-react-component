# React Create Component
![](https://github.com/mattveraldi/react-create-component-extension/blob/master/Demo.gif?raw=true)
## The problem ‚ùå
The boilerplate to create a React component is often the same and can be automated.

## The solution üéâ
Right-click on the folder that you want your component to be placed in, select 'Create React Component', type its name and it's done!

## State of art üé°
For now the extension is very minimalistic, it will create a **Stateless Javascript functional component** with a CSS file for the stylesheet and a folder with a basic setup for its unit tests (@testing-library).

## Installation
You can download the .vsix file from this repository and [install it manually.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix)
