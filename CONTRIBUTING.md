Your code should be readable, so overall there shouldn't be too much comments, don't be afraid to add them where they are needed... But if you add a lot of them, maybe you should try to refactor your code to make it more readable and understandable. \

Try to keep code organized in folder structures.
Readability and Mantainability are the keys.

# Some ideas for Next steps

* [ ] Refactor the extension to support multiple component's types.
* [ ] Add typescript component's case.
* [ ] Add support for different stylesheet' types. (es. css/sass/less) 
* [ ] Add support for different test environments.
